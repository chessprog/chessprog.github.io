My game Gameproject file you play as a square who is journeying to be its own video game character. There's one level, and that is to pass the first test in becoming a video game character. Going through the platformer you must jump over fiery pits of rejection, and reach the last platform to become the game character that the square was always meant to be. The only enemy is being rejected by the developer. To move your character, you use the w, a, and d keys with the w to jump, a to move left, and d to move to the right. When your character dies and goes into the fiery pits of rejection and the game resets to try again. So, journey through as a square, and reach your destination in becoming the ultimate video character.
